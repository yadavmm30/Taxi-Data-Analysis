# Taxi-Analysis

This project seeks to address the gap in research by identifying if there are other factors other than weather that may affect the amount of tipping by those who paid their fares by credit card.In other words, if weather has the potential to affect behavior for tipping in taxicabs (Devaraj & Patel, 2017), there may be other factors, such as socio-economic variables, that may affect a person’s behavior and thus the amount they choose to tip. Focusing on the variables provided in the NYC taxicab dataset is beneficial because those variables are the ones the drivers “interact” with; they cannot see wealth or know a passenger’s background, but they can make inferences (and subsequently guess tip amount) based on appearances and their pick up and drop off locations (Ayres et al., 2005).
